Currently a Principal Technial Architect at Vanquis Bank.

I'm a true techy at heart and love to continuously learn and improve. My main passions in tech are Event-Driven Architecture and DDD. 

This blog is a place for me to write about some of the things I am passionate about, have some healthy discussions and hopefully share some of my opinions and knowledge in the tech space.
